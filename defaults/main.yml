# Role default lower priority variables

# List of dicts with mounts to configure. The dicts have the same attributes
# that the ones expected by the ansible mount module. For example:
#
# mounts:
#   - path: /mnt/tmp
#     src: /dev/sdb
#     fstype: xfs
#     opts: noatime
#     state: present
#
# Additionally, if you set to `yes` the variable `mounts_create_paths` detailed
# below, you can specify the following attributes for the mount point, that have
# the same meaning that in ansible `file` module:
#
# - owner
# - group
# - mode
# - seuser
# - serole
# - setype
# - selevel
#
# If the src, fstype and opts are not defined, the role will get it from current
# facts for already mounted filesystems.
#
# If path, src and fstype cannot be determined the role will skip that item.

mounts: []

# Dicitionary with the defaults options to use if no other ones are specified in
# the `mounts` variable. The members of the dict are the same attributes
# that the ones expected by the ansible mount module

mounts_defaults:
  state: present

# Create or not mount points paths if they doesn't exist

mounts_create_paths: yes

# Number of retries during mount/umount operations

mounts_retries: 5

# Delay between retries

mounts_delay: 10

# Indicate `mounts` must be loaded also from host variables. Any host variable
# that begins with "mounts_*" and contains the necessary attributes
# will be loaded as an item to manage by the role. The variables must follow the
# structure detailed before for `mounts`

mounts_load_from_hostvars: no
