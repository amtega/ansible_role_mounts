# Role default lower priority variables

# List of dicts with mounts to configure. The dicts have the same attributes
# that the ones expected by the ansible mount module. For example:
#
# mounts:
#   - path: /mnt/tmp
#     src: /dev/sdb
#     fstype: xfs
#     opts: noatime
#     state: present
#
# Additionally, if you set to `yes` the variable `mounts_create_paths` detailed
# below, you can specify the following attributes for the mount point, that have
# the same meaning that in ansible `file` module:
#
# - owner
# - group
# - mode

mounts: []

# Dicitionary with the defaults options to use if no other ones are specified in
# the `mounts` variable. The members of the dict are the same attributes
# that the ones expected by the ansible mount module

mounts_defaults:
  state: present

# Create or not mount points paths if they doesn't exist

mounts_create_paths: yes
