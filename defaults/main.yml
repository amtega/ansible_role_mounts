# List of dicts with mounts to configure. The dicts have the same attributes
# that the ones expected by the ansible mount module. For example:
#
# mounts:
#   - path: /mnt/tmp
#     src: /dev/sdb
#     fstype: xfs
#     opts: noatime
#     state: present

# Dicitionary with the defaults options to use if no other ones are specified in
# the `mounts` variable. The members of the dict are the same attributes
# that the ones expected by the ansible mount module
